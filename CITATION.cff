abstract: "WaTEM/SEDEM is a soil erosion and sediment delivery model used for catchment-scale simulations.
The model incorporates a Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) module to simulate gross erosion,
extended with a spatially explicit sediment routing module to simulate sediment transport based on a cellular
transport capacity. The model therefore provides the user with estimations of gross and net soil erosion at
the catchment scale.

WaTEM/SEDEM has been applied for numerous applications considering both the on-site and off-site impacts of soil
erosion. These applications include the predicted soil loss from fields, off-site deposition, estimations of
catchment sediment yield. The model has also been extended for the simulation of transported heavy metals,
nutrients, organic carbon and runoff (CN). The default application of the model can be extended in several ways to simulate
the impact of soil erosion mitigation measures in a spatially explicit way. For example, additional options within
the model allow for the consideration of other anthropogenic factors such as roads, sewage systems, water and sediment
buffer basins, dams and ditches.

Version 5.0.2 was created to auto-publish the binaries for watem-sedem on GitHub."
