############
Model output
############

In this section we will describe all possible outputs of WaTEM/SEDEM. Tables
are written as tab-delimited txt-files, rasters are written as
`Idrisi-rasters <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/Idrisi.html>`_ (or as
`Saga-rasters <https://gdal.org/drivers/raster/sdat.html>`_ if the
':ref:`saga grids <sagagrids>`' option is enabled).

The output returned by the model depends on some of the
:ref:`user choices <choicespage>` that can be defined in the ini-file.

.. _onlyroutingoutput:

Only Routing output
###################

Following output is generated if the model option
‘:ref:`only routing <onlyrouting>`’ is enabled:

.. _routingtxt:

routing.txt
***********

Tab-delimited table, containing a row for every pixel in the spatial domain.
Following columns are present for every pixel (every pixel is a row in the
table):

* **col**: the vertical position of the pixel in the raster
* **row**: the horizontal position of the pixel in the raster
* **target1col**: the vertical position of the first target pixel in the raster.
  These values are -99 if target1 does not exist.
* **target1row**: the horizontal position of the first target pixel in the raster.
  These values are -99 if target1 does not exist.
* part1: the relative amount of outgoing sediment/water to the first target
  pixel
* distance1: the distance (in m) between the source pixel and the first target
  pixel
* **target2col**: the vertical position of the second target pixel in the raster.
  These values are -99 if target2 does not exist.
* **target2row**: the horizontal position of the second target pixel in the raster.
  These values are -99 if target2 does not exist.
* part2: the relative amount of outgoing sediment/water to the second target
  pixel. *The sum of part1 and part2 must equal 1.*
* distance2: the distance (in m) between the source pixel and the second target
  pixel

The routing table will only be generated if the model choice
':ref:`write routing table <writerouting>`' is enabled.

An example of (a part) of a routing.txt is given below

.. literalinclude:: ../testfiles/molenbeek/modeloutput_ref/routing.txt
    :language: text
    :lines: 1-15

See :ref:`the section on grid coordinates <gridcoordinates>` for more
information on the orientation of the rows and columns in this file.

.. _missingroutingtxt:

routing_missing.txt
*******************

Tab-delimited table with the same headers as :ref:`routing.txt <routingtxt>`.
The records in this table are a subset of those in routing.txt and are only
included if they were not treated in te model after the routing is calculated.
This output is intended as debugging information for the model. Ideally, this
file is empty. 

This table will only be generated if the model choice
':ref:`write routing table <writerouting>`' is enabled.

See :ref:`the section on grid coordinates <gridcoordinates>` for more
information on the orientation of the rows and columns in this file.

.. _routingcolrow:

routing_rowcol.txt
******************

Tab-delimited table. Every row represents a pixel coordinate (column + row).
The pixels are sorted according to the sequence they are treated in the modelrun:
i.e. the first record int the table is the pixel treated first in the modelrun,
the last record of the table is the last treated pixel of the modelrun.
Together with the :ref:`routing.txt <routingtxt>`, the routing applied by the model
can be fully reconstructed.

This table will only be generated if the model choice
':ref:`write routing table <writerouting>`' is enabled.

An example of (a part) of a routing_rowcol.txt is given below

.. literalinclude:: ../testfiles/molenbeek/modeloutput_ref/routing_rowcol.txt
    :language: text

the following rasters and tables can be written as output.

.. _totalsedimenttxt:

Total Sediment.txt
******************

Txt-file where the first rows give a summary of the results:

* Total erosion :math:`(kg)`: the total amount of sediment eroded in the landscape.
  Erosion is expressed as a negative value.

  For every pixel in the model domain that is not a buffer exit, sewer, river or outside the model domain where

  .. math::
      S_i - S_o < 0

  with

  - :math:`S_i`: the incoming sediment of a pixel
  - :math:`S_o`: the outgoing sediment of a pixel

  the erosion :math:`E (kg)` is calculated as

  .. math::
      E = (S_i - S_o) * BD

  with :math:`BD`the :ref:`bulk density <bulkdensity>`

  The total erosion is calculated as the sum of all erosion values in the model domain.


* Total deposition :math:`(kg)`: the total amount of sediment deposited in the landscape
  (not entering sewers or rivers)

  For every pixel in the model domain that is not a buffer exit, sewer, river or outside the model domain where

  .. math::
      S_i - S_o \geqslant 0

  with

  - :math:`S_i`: the incoming sediment of a pixel
  - :math:`S_o`: the outgoing sediment of a pixel

  the deposition :math:`D (kg)` is calculated as

  .. math::
      D = (S_i - S_o) * BD

  with :math:`BD`the :ref:`bulk density <bulkdensity>`

  The total deposition is calculated as the sum of all erosion values in the model domain.

* Sediment leaving the catchment, via the river :math:`(kg)`: the total amount of sediment
  that enters any of the river pixels. This amount of sediment is not included in the calculation of the total
  deposition value.

* Sediment leaving the catchment, not via the river :math:`(kg)`: the amount of sediment
  that exits the model domain (not via river pixels). This amount of sediment is not included in the calculation of the
  total deposition value.
  
if the model extension ':ref:`Include buffers <includebuffers>`' is enabled, following row is added to the file:

* Sediment trapped in buffers :math:`(kg)`: the amount of sediment that is trapped in
  all buffer basins. This amount of sediment is not included in the calculation of the total deposition value.
  
if the model extension ':ref:`Include sewers <inlcudesewers>`' is enabled, following row is added to the file:

* Sediment entering sewer system :math:`(kg)`: the amount of sediment that enters the sewer pixels.
  This amount of sediment is not included in the Total deposition value.

After the above mentioned rows, a tab-separated table where for every outlet
the amount of incoming sediment is reported.
